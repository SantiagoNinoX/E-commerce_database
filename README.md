A program was developed to allow users to purchase various selected products from the offered menu through the use of objects and classes, as well as the implementation of inheritance and composition, summarizing everything in a main program.

A list of all the products available for sale on the E-commerce website was created. Based on the products, users determine their ID, name, address, and whether they have a VIP subscription eligible for discounts on their purchase.

Based on the selected products, which have a specific ID, name, and price, the total amount to be paid is calculated, considering several situations, such as adding or removing products from the cart, as well as various discounts depending on the customer type: regular (with no discounts other than those based on quantity) or VIP (which vary depending on the tier: gold, platinum, or diamond).
